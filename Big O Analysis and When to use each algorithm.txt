Selection Sort: O(n^2):

Any situation where the number of items is small and/or to check if something is sorted

Shell Sort: O(n^2):

Good for a list of wildly unsorted numbers due to the fact that it checks far apart numbers first, 
though i feel that it would be quite slow on a large list and it wouldn't speed up much if it was already 
partially sorted

Merge Sort: O(nlogn):

Great for sorting large lists of items as long as space is of no concern
