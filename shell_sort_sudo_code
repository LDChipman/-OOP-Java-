1. Find the gap

2. compare the numbers at index 0 and index + gap

3. swap them if num 1 is higher than num 2

4. if swapped then check the numbers at index 0 - gap and index 0 and run from step 3 with index being set to 0 - gap

5. continue at the original index

6. compare numbers at original index and index + gap and run from step 3 until youve checked all numbers in the array

7. set gap to gap/2 and run from step 2 until gap = 0
