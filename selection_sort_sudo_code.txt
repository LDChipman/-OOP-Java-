1. take an array of integers and an index to start at named i

2. if i is greater than the than the length of the array return the now sorted list

3. set the integer at index i to a variable named min

4. for each integer in the array check if it is lower than min

5. if the number is lower than min then save that number to min and the index of min otherwise check the next number

6. once youve checked all swap the number at index i with the number at the index min was at

7. rerun this code with the array and the index + 1
